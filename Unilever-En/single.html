						<h2>Macros and power BI at Unilever</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					During my participation in the project, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project that
					was divided into two phases. In the first phase, it was an internal process that used Excel MACROS,
					and it was required to automate this process to improve its efficiency. On the other hand, the main
					phase of the project was to create a Power BI Dashboard with the objective of facilitating
					decision-making for the directors of Unilever Mexico. (The images were rearranged to protect the
					privacy of the data I was given)
				</p>

				<p></p>
				<p>
					As previously mentioned, the first part of the project consisted of creating an Excel MACRO to
					consolidate the 7 large databases, avoiding the human error that resulted from doing this process
					manually. During the process mapping, I realized the great potential that this phase had, as the
					manual process took about 2 hours to complete.</p>
				<p>As I progressed in this stage, I managed to create the program in just under a week, performing
					exhaustive tests to ensure its correct functioning. In the end, the new runtime was significantly
					more efficient, reducing the time used by 91.6%, from 2 hours to just 10 minute</p>

				<p></p>
				<p>
					The second phase of the project was the most important, as it involved designing a dashboard that
					connected around 10 databases extracted from different places containing vital information for the
					company. The main request was to have visibility in pallets as well as in euros and also in boxes.
					In addition, it was necessary to be able to see the product status in the different months, as well
					as certain metrics.
				</p>
				<p> This phase was very challenging due to the large amount of information that was being handled, as
					well as the inclusion of many filters, formulas, and types of decisions that had to be added.
					However, after two weeks of constant work, I successfully completed the dashboard and had the
					fortune to personally present it to the director, who would be the main user.</p>
