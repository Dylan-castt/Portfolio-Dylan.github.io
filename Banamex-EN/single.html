					Banorte Benefits was created with the goal of reducing employee turnover among Generation Z
					employees at Banorte. Initially, an environmental analysis was conducted to understand the needs and
					desires of young people in a work environment, which allowed for the creation of a User Persona.
					Then, a solution was proposed, and the return on investment (ROI) was investigated. Subsequently, a
					prototype of a web page was developed.

					To gain a deeper understanding of what Banorte employees wanted in their workplace, a survey was
					conducted of 60 people. The results showed that 71.7% of respondents preferred to have flexibility
					in terms of work schedules and formats. Through further research within the company, it was found
					that the lack of flexible working hours was the main reason for resignation, with 40% of the votes,
					followed by economic and growth concerns, with 35% of the votes. Based on these results, it was
					decided to focus Banorte Benefits' efforts on meeting these flexibility and growth needs.</p>
				<p>An exhaustive investigation was carried out on the behaviors and preferences of Generation Z, and our
					"User persona" was created to understand how our target audience thinks and interacts with their
					environment.</p>

					Banorte Benefits was created as a flexible benefits model to provide an immediate sense of growth
					and reduce employee turnover among Generation Z. A hierarchical structure of benefits was designed
					divided into levels (Entry, Junior, Senior, Director) and sub-levels (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) so
					that employees can choose a benefit every time they advance to the corresponding level. An
					accumulation system of points based on the goals of each position and their fulfillment was
					established to advance from level to level within a period of 1 to 3 years. The benefits were
					carefully selected based on exhaustive research into what young people value in a job and are
					reasonable in cost according to the position held. Likewise, the company philosophy of "Each
					collaborator sets and advances their career at the pace they want" would be maintained.

				<p>Before building the Banorte Benefits prototype, a thorough financial analysis was conducted of the
					expected return on investment. The conclusion reached was that the implementation of this benefits
					package can generate a significant return on investment. By offering employees an attractive and
					flexible option, their job satisfaction and commitment can be improved, which in turn translates
					into increased productivity and talent retention. Additionally, reducing employee turnover reduces
					the costs associated with hiring and training new employees.</p>
				<p>To measure the return on investment of the proposal, financial indicators such as increased
					productivity, reduced hiring and training costs, and decreased absenteeism and illness expenses can
					be used. Intangible factors such as improved work environment and the company's image in front of
					employees and the market should also be considered. It is important to highlight that three possible
					scenarios were created for our proposal, which are achievable turnover objectives and clearly
					demonstrate that Banorte Benefits is a profitable investment for the company.</p>
